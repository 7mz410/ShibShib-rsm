description: Build and publish ShibShib rsm: the macOS app bundle, the web (WebAssembly) build, and the GitHub Pages deployment at 7mz410.github.io/ShibShib-rsm, with an Arabic and English screenshot check before publishing. Use whenever the user asks to update the web version, deploy, publish, release, give them a link to try, build the Mac app, or "ارفع النسخة" / "حدّث الويب" / "بدي لينك", and after any change to the interface that the user should see.

# Release ShibShib rsm

The web build is what the user actually tries, so a broken or un-branded deploy costs trust.
Every release is therefore gated on tests and on looking at the result in both languages.

Repo: `~/Documents/ShibShib-rsm`. Scripts are in this skill's `scripts/` folder.

## Steps

1. Gates first:
   - `cargo test -q -p vectorcraft-ui-egui`. The only known failure is upstream's
     `save_a_copy_and_template_suggest_their_names`. Report any other failure and stop.
   - `cargo xtask assets` and `cargo xtask brands`.
2. Build: `bash <skill>/scripts/release.sh --web` (add `--mac` when the user wants the app).
3. Look before publishing. Serve `dist/web` locally, then take screenshots with
   `scripts/screenshot.mjs`, using `ar` and then `en`:
   ```sh
   cd ~/Documents/ShibShib-rsm/dist/web && python3 -m http.server 8799 &
   node <skill>/scripts/screenshot.mjs http://localhost:8799/ ar /tmp/rsm-ar.png
   node <skill>/scripts/screenshot.mjs http://localhost:8799/ en /tmp/rsm-en.png
   pkill -f "http.server 8799"
   ```
   `playwright-core` must be installed in the folder you run node from, or in a scratch folder.
   Read both images. Check that:
   - the start screen draws;
   - Arabic letters join and words read right to left;
   - numbers and sizes are not reversed;
   - the name is "ShibShib rsm";
   - no ArtCraft or Discord branding is visible.
4. Publish: `bash <skill>/scripts/release.sh --deploy`. Then confirm the live page answers 200 and
   its `<title>` says ShibShib rsm (GitHub Pages can take a minute).
5. Make sure `main` is pushed, so the release matches a commit on GitHub.

## Report to the user (Arabic, short)

The live link, what changed since the last release, anything visibly wrong in the screenshots,
and the path to `ShibShib rsm.app` if it was built. The Mac build isn't signed: the user opens
it the first time with right-click › Open.
