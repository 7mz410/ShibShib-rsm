## Built on VectorCraft

ShibShib rsm is a fork of **[VectorCraft](https://github.com/storytold/vectorcraft)**, the open-source,
clean-room vector illustration app written in Rust by the **[ArtCraft](https://getartcraft.com/)** team
and the VectorCraft contributors. Almost everything that makes this app work is their work. Thank you.

If you like ShibShib rsm, please star and support the upstream project as well:
[github.com/storytold/vectorcraft](https://github.com/storytold/vectorcraft) ·
[getartcraft.com/apps](https://getartcraft.com/apps).

ShibShib adds its own branding and, next, a full Arabic and English interface with right-to-left
layout. Our changes are listed in [`shibshib/CHANGES.md`](shibshib/CHANGES.md); we aim to send
improvements that help everyone, such as the Arabic translation, back upstream.

## Quick start

Requires a recent stable Rust toolchain.

```sh
cargo run --release -p vectorcraft      # desktop app
cargo xtask bundle                      # macOS app bundle in dist/
cd apps/vectorcraft-web && trunk build --release   # web build
```

Features, file formats, the command API and the MCP server for agents are the same as upstream; see
the [upstream README](https://github.com/storytold/vectorcraft#readme), [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md) and
[`docs/`](docs).

## Keeping up with upstream

```sh
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main
python3 shibshib/rebrand.py
```
