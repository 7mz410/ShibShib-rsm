# VectorCraft MCP server

`vectorcraft-cli mcp` runs a [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server on stdio
(newline-delimited JSON-RPC 2.0, protocol `2025-06-18`; `2025-03-26` and `2024-11-05` also accepted). Agents use it to
draw, inspect and look at VectorCraft documents.

It has two backends:

| Mode | How | What works |
|---|---|---|
| **Remote** | `vectorcraft-cli mcp --connect 127.0.0.1:7979` (the app must run with `vectorcraft --control 7979`) | Everything. Tool calls are forwarded over the [control protocol](control-protocol.md), so you watch the app change live. |
| **Headless** | `vectorcraft-cli mcp --headless` | An in-process engine session with a CPU renderer. Everything except the UI-only tools (`inspect_ui`, `type_text`, `open_panel`, `screenshot {window:true}`). |

With no flag, the server tries `127.0.0.1:7979` and falls back to headless. Logs go to stderr; stdout carries
only protocol messages.

## Build and register

```sh
cargo build --release -p vectorcraft-cli
claude mcp add vectorcraft -- "$PWD/target/release/vectorcraft-cli" mcp
# or pin a mode:
claude mcp add vectorcraft-headless -- "$PWD/target/release/vectorcraft-cli" mcp --headless
claude mcp add vectorcraft-app -- "$PWD/target/release/vectorcraft-cli" mcp --connect 127.0.0.1:7979
```

Other clients use the same command in their JSON config:

```json
{"mcpServers": {"vectorcraft": {"command": "/abs/path/target/release/vectorcraft-cli", "args": ["mcp"]}}}
```

For a live session, start the app first: `cargo run --release -p vectorcraft -- --control 7979`.

## Tools

Coordinates are points in document space: y points down, the origin is the first artboard's top-left, and a new
document is 612 × 792 (US Letter). New objects become the selection. Most commands act on the selection or on
explicit `ids`.

Paint values (`fill`, `stroke`) accept `"#rrggbb"`, `"none"`, `[r,g,b]` (0..1), `{"c","m","y","k"}`, `{"gray"}`,
or a full `paint.setFill` params object (`{"gradient": …}`, `{"swatch": "name"}`).
The Fill/Stroke proxy commands run through `run_command`: `paint.invert` and `paint.complement` recolour the active
proxy keeping each colour's model, `paint.lastColor` / `paint.lastGradient` re-apply the last solid colour or gradient,
and `paint.recent` returns the recent colours that every paint command (and the eyedropper) feeds.
`paint.proxies` returns what the proxies show: the fill and stroke, which one is active, and whether the selected
objects' fills or strokes differ (`fillMixed` / `strokeMixed`, drawn as a "?" proxy).

| Tool | Arguments | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `list_commands` | `{filter?, enabledOnly?}` | The command catalogue: id, label, menu, shortcut, params doc, enablement. |
| `run_command` | `{command, params?}` | Runs any command. Use it for everything without a dedicated tool. |
| `inspect_document` | `{}` | Artboards, layer tree (ids, kinds, bounds, paint), selection, history, tool. |
| `inspect_ui` | `{}` | UI state. Remote mode only. |
| `select_tool` | `{tool}` | `selection`, `directSelection`, `pen`, `rectangle`, `ellipse`, `polygon`, `star`, `lineSegment`, … |
| `pointer_gesture` | `{events:[{kind,x,y,mods?}], tool?, mods?}` | `kind` is one of `down`, `drag`, `up`, `move`, `doubleclick`. Events go through the same path as the mouse. |
| `draw_path` | `{points \| d, closed?, fill?, stroke?, strokeWidth?}` | `points` is `[[x,y],…]` or `[{x,y,in?,out?,smooth?},…]`. `d` is SVG path data. |
| `draw_shape` | `{shape, …geometry, fill?, stroke?, strokeWidth?}` | `rectangle`/`ellipse`: `x,y,width,height` (plus `radius` for corners). `polygon`: `cx,cy,radius,sides`. `star`: `cx,cy,radius1,radius2,points`. `line`: `x1,y1,x2,y2`. |
| `set_paint` | `{fill?, stroke?, strokeWidth?, ids?}` | Applies to the selection (or `ids`) and becomes the default for new art. |
| `press_key` | `{key, mods?}` | Remote: a real key event. Headless: runs the command or tool bound to that shortcut, or sends the key to the busy tool. |
| `type_text` | `{text}` | Remote only. |
| `invoke_menu` | `{command, params?}` | Invokes a menu item by command id. Includes UI commands such as `view.*` and `window.*` in remote mode. |
| `open_panel` | `{panel}` | Remote only. |
| `screenshot` | `{path?, scale?, artboard?, window?}` | Returns MCP image content (`image/png`, base64) plus a text block. Renders the artboard; `window:true` captures the app window (remote only). |
| `open_file` | `{path}` | Opens any readable file as a new active document: `.vectorcraft`/`.drawcraft`, `.svg`/`.svgz`, `.pdf`/`.ai`, `.ait`, PNG, JPEG, GIF, WebP, TIFF, BMP (an image opens as a document of its pixel size). Templates open as a new untitled document. `run_command document.formats` lists the formats. |
| `save_file` | `{path?}` | Saves in the native `.vectorcraft` format. |
| `export` | `{path?, format?, scale?, artboard?, range?, selection?, outlineText?, options?}` | `svg`, `pdf`, `png`, `jpg`, `webp` or `vectorcraft` (the list comes from `document.formats`). When `format` is omitted, it comes from the path's extension. PDF writes one page per artboard: all of them, or `artboard` (0-based) / `range` (`"1-3, 5"`, 1-based); the other formats write one artboard. `options` carries more format options (e.g. `{"quality": 80}` for JPEG). `selection: true` exports the selected objects cropped to their bounds; `outlineText: true` writes SVG text as paths. Template layers are left out, live effects are kept, and exporting `vectorcraft` never changes the document's path. Without `path` the bytes come back as `dataBase64`. Both backends run the same `document.export` call. |
| `add_text` | `{text, x?, y?, width?, height?, path?, mode?, pathEffect?, size?, font?, color?}` | Point type at (x, y); area type with `width`/`height`; or `path` + `mode` (`area`/`onPath`) to flow text in or along a path, with `pathEffect` (`rainbow`, `skew`, `3dRibbon`, `stairStep`, `gravity`). |
| `apply_effect` | `{effect?, params?, ids?}` | Appends a live effect. Without `effect`, returns the effect catalogue with parameters and defaults. |
| `pathfinder` | `{operation, ids?}` | `unite`, `minusFront`, `intersect`, `exclude`, `divide`, `trim`, `merge`, `crop`, `outline`, `minusBack`. For a live version, apply the `pathfinder.*` effect to a group. |
| `transform` | `{ids?, dx?, dy?, rotate?, scale?, scaleX?, scaleY?, reflect?, shear?, origin?, copy?}` | Runs move, rotate, scale, reflect, shear in that order. With `copy`, the first step duplicates. |
| `create_graph` | `{type?, x, y, width, height, csv? \| series?, categories?, rows?}` | The nine Illustrator graph types: column, stacked column, bar, stacked bar, line, area, scatter, pie and radar. Edit later with `graph.setData` / `graph.setType` via `run_command`. |
| `text_wrap` | `{ids?, offset?, invert?, release?}` | Area type below the objects (same layer) flows around them. |
| `undo` / `redo` | `{}` | |

Appearance stacks: an object can carry several fills and strokes (`appearance.addFill`, `appearance.addStroke`), indexed
in paint order (0 is painted first, the bottom row of the Appearance panel). `paint.setFill`, `paint.setStroke`,
`stroke.set`, `stroke.setAdvanced`, `paint.editGradient`, `paint.setGradientGeom` and `transparency.set` take
`item` to edit one of them; `run_command appearance.setActiveItem {"index": n}` makes that row the target of later
calls that omit `item` (as clicking the row in the Appearance panel does) until the selection changes; the proxy of
its kind (`paint.proxies`) and the Gradient tool's annotator then show that row.
`inspect_document` reports it as `paint.appearanceItem`. Live effects take the same `item` to apply to one fill or
stroke instead of the whole object: `run_command effect.apply {"effect": "path.offsetPath", "item": 0}`, and
`effect.remove`, `effect.setParams` (`visible` toggles one) and `effect.duplicate` address that item's effects;
`apply_effect` uses the active item. `effect.list` reports each object's item effects under `applied[].items`.

Errors (unknown tool, bad arguments, a disabled or failing command) come back as a normal result with
`isError: true` and a message. The model can read the message and retry.

Swatches go through `run_command`: `swatch.list` lists every swatch with its colour group, kind and colour;
`swatch.edit {name, newName?, color?, mode?, global?, spot?}` edits one (fills, strokes and text linked to a
global or spot swatch follow its colour and name, as one undo step); `swatch.delete {names, unlink?}` deletes
swatches and colour groups in one undo step (art using a deleted global swatch keeps its colour, unlinked).
`swatch.new {color?, mode?, spot?, global?, group?}` saves a colour (into a colour group with `group`), gradient
or pattern; `swatch.newGroup {fromArtwork: true, toGlobal?, includeTints?}` makes a colour group of the selected
art's colours (by default as global swatches the art links to).
`swatch.move {names, to?, group?}` reorders swatches or moves them into or out of a colour group (as dragging
them in the Swatches panel does); give colour group names instead to reorder the groups. Dropping a swatch on art
in the app runs `paint.setFill` (or `paint.setStroke`, the active proxy) with `ids: [the object under the pointer]`.
The Swatches panel menu's commands: `swatch.addUsedColors {selection?, global?}`, `swatch.unused` (a query: the
names Select All Unused selects), `swatch.merge {names}` (the first is kept), `swatch.ungroup {name}` and
`swatch.sortByKind`.
Document colour mode: `file.new {colorMode: "cmyk"}` starts a CMYK document with CMYK default swatches, and RGB
colours applied to it (`paint.setFill`/`setStroke` colours and gradient stops, `swatch.new`) are stored as CMYK;
Gray stays Gray, and `keepModel: true` keeps a colour as given. RGB documents keep colours as given. Harmonies, Edit
Colors blends, inversions and Recolor Artwork keep each colour's model (a blend between models takes the document's).
`swatch.new {colors: [...]}` saves several colours as swatches in one undo step. `color.harmony {color, rule, steps?, variation?, amount?}` answers what the Color
Guide panel shows: the harmony rule's colours, base first, and per colour its row of `2·steps+1` variations
(shades, cool or muted on the left, tints, warm or vivid on the right).

Draw, look, export:

```json
{"name":"draw_shape","arguments":{"shape":"rectangle","x":72,"y":72,"width":200,"height":120,"radius":12,"fill":"#1e88e5","stroke":"none"}}
{"name":"draw_shape","arguments":{"shape":"star","cx":400,"cy":300,"radius1":90,"radius2":40,"points":5,"fill":"#ffc107","stroke":"#000000","strokeWidth":2}}

```

Long-tail commands:

```json

{"name":"run_command","arguments":{"command":"select.all"}}
{"name":"run_command","arguments":{"command":"object.align","params":{"align":"left"}}}
{"name":"run_command","arguments":{"command":"object.group"}}
```

Drive a tool like a mouse:

```json
{"name":"pointer_gesture","arguments":{"tool":"ellipse","events":[
  {"kind":"down","x":100,"y":100},{"kind":"drag","x":150,"y":140},{"kind":"up","x":200,"y":180}]}}
```

Edit a gradient with the Gradient tool's annotator (the bar runs along the vector; stop chips sit 10 px under
it, midpoint diamonds 7 px above): a click on the bar adds a stop, dragging a chip moves it (drag it off the bar to
delete it, hold Alt to copy it), dragging the end handle changes the vector. The selected stop
(`gradient.selectStop`) takes Delete and ←/→:

```json
{"name":"run_command","arguments":{"command":"paint.setFill","params":{"gradient":{"start":[100,150],"end":[200,150]}}}}
{"name":"pointer_gesture","arguments":{"tool":"gradient","events":[{"kind":"down","x":130,"y":150},{"kind":"up","x":130,"y":150}]}}
{"name":"pointer_gesture","arguments":{"events":[{"kind":"down","x":130,"y":160},{"kind":"drag","x":160,"y":160},{"kind":"up","x":160,"y":160}]}}
{"name":"press_key","arguments":{"key":"Delete"}}
```

Raw protocol (for debugging):

```sh
printf '%s\n' \
  '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"initialize","params":{"protocolVersion":"2025-06-18","capabilities":{},"clientInfo":{"name":"sh","version":"0"}}}' \
  '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"notifications/initialized"}' \
  '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":2,"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"draw_shape","arguments":{"shape":"ellipse","x":10,"y":10,"width":100,"height":80,"fill":"#ff0000"}}}' \

```

## Headless batch CLI

```sh
vectorcraft-cli commands                          # command catalogue (JSON)
vectorcraft-cli run --in in.svg \
  --cmd select.all --cmd paint.setFill --params '{"color":"#ff0000"}' \
  --export out.svg --export out.png --scale 2
vectorcraft-cli run --cmd file.new --params '{"width":800,"height":600}' \
  --cmd shape.star --params '{"cx":400,"cy":300,"radius1":200,"radius2":90}' \
  --export star.vectorcraft
```

`run` prints one JSON line per step (`open`, `cmd`, `export`) and exits non-zero on the first failure. `--params`
applies to the `--cmd` just before it. `run` also accepts the host commands `file.open`, `file.save`, `file.export`,
`file.exportForScreens` and `tool.select`. `run --in`, `convert` and `info` read every format `document.open` reads
(`vectorcraft-cli --help` lists them).

## Transparency and opacity masks

Transparency and opacity-mask commands take `ids` (or `id`), so they need no selection. Opacity is a percentage
(0..100) in every command (`transparency.set`, `object.setProps`, `appearance.setItem`). `transparency.info` returns
the Transparency panel's values, with `null` where the objects differ. Making a mask from one object gives it an
empty mask and enters mask editing: art drawn then becomes the mask, and the mask commands act on the masked object
until `transparency.stopEditingOpacityMask`. Saves and exports never include the editing layer.

```json
{"name":"run_command","arguments":{"command":"transparency.set","params":{"ids":[12],"opacity":40,"blend":"Multiply"}}}
{"name":"run_command","arguments":{"command":"transparency.makeOpacityMask","params":{"ids":[12,15],"invert":true}}}
{"name":"run_command","arguments":{"command":"transparency.setOpacityMask","params":{"id":12,"clip":false}}}
{"name":"run_command","arguments":{"command":"transparency.info","params":{"ids":[12,20]}}}
```

Knockout Group has three states: `transparency.set {knockout: "on"|"off"|"neutral"}` (`true` = on, `false` =
neutral, the default). In a knockout group each child hides what it covers of the children below it; neutral groups
pass the enclosing group's setting to their children, off groups never knock out. `knockoutShape: true` makes the
object's opacity and opacity mask scale how much it knocks out. `transparency.togglePageKnockoutGroup` and
`transparency.togglePageIsolatedBlending` (`{value?}`) treat the whole page as a knockout or isolated group; they are
saved with the document and undoable, and `transparency.info` reports them. PDF and SVG write knockout groups as
soft-masked groups with the same look (the PDF export reports a warning).

Groups are not isolated unless Isolate Blending is on: a blend mode inside a group with opacity, a blend mode, an
opacity mask, knockout or a clip reaches the art below the group, on screen and in PDF (a knockout group's elements
then composite against the art below it). SVG has no non-isolated groups, so there such groups stay isolated.

## Clipping masks

`object.clippingMask.make` clips the selected objects by the topmost one, which may be a path, a compound path or a
text object (it loses its paint). Compound holes, even-odd fills, glyph outlines and the union of a group's members
clip alike on screen, in raster export and in SVG and PDF. `object.clippingMask.release` turns the clip group into a
plain group and keeps the clipping path, unpainted.

```json
{"name":"run_command","arguments":{"command":"select.set","params":{"ids":[12,15]}}}
{"name":"run_command","arguments":{"command":"object.clippingMask.make","params":{}}}
```

`layer.clippingMask.toggle {id?}` is the Layers panel's clipping mask button: the top object of the layer `id` (default:
the one selected group, else the current layer) becomes its clipping path (unpainted, moved to the bottom of the layer,
so art added later is clipped too); called again it releases the mask. It returns `{clip}`, and the Layers panel
underlines clipping-path names.

## Graphic styles

A graphic style holds an appearance (fills, strokes, effects) plus opacity, blend mode, isolate and knockout.
`graphicStyle.new {name?, id?}` captures an object (a group without its own fills or strokes lends its topmost
object's, type its characters'). `graphicStyle.apply {name, ids?}` gives the objects the style and links them;
`add: true` adds the style on top of the existing appearance instead. Linked objects stay linked while they keep the
style's look: editing their appearance or transparency breaks the link, and `graphicStyle.redefine {name?, id?}`
updates only the objects still linked. `graphicStyle.list` returns each style with the ids linked to it and the
style of the first selected object; `select.same.graphicStyle` selects an object's fellow users.
Styles keep placed gradients relative to the bounds of the object they were made from, and each object a
style is applied to gets them at the same place relative to its own bounds.

```json
{"name":"run_command","arguments":{"command":"graphicStyle.new","params":{"id":12,"name":"Glow"}}}
{"name":"run_command","arguments":{"command":"graphicStyle.apply","params":{"name":"Glow","ids":[15,20]}}}
{"name":"run_command","arguments":{"command":"graphicStyle.redefine","params":{"id":12}}}
{"name":"run_command","arguments":{"command":"graphicStyle.list","params":{}}}
```

## Editing appearance stacks

`effect.move {from, to, fromItem?, toItem?, copy?}` reorders an effect or moves it between the object's effects
(`null`) and a fill's or stroke's (an item index), as dragging its row in the Appearance panel does; `copy: true` copies
it (Alt-drag). `appearance.duplicateItem {index, to?}` / `{indices}` and `appearance.removeItem {index | indices}`
act on several fills/strokes at once, and `appearance.showAllHidden` makes every hidden fill, stroke and effect
visible again. In remote mode, `effect.dialog {effect, index, item}` opens an applied effect's dialog prefilled
(`ui.dialog.confirm` runs `effect.setParams`); see the control protocol for the "already applied" question.

## Overprint

Each fill and stroke (and each character's fill and stroke) can overprint: its inks print over the inks below instead
of knocking them out. `object.setOverprint {fill?, stroke?, item?, ids?}` sets it (groups set their contents, type its
characters too; `item` aims at one appearance item) and `attributes.info {ids?}` reads it back (`null` where the
objects differ). Overprint Preview (`view.overprintPreview`) and Separations Preview show it; rendering approximates
it by multiplying. Older files that listed Overprint Black objects in the document get the flags on load.

```json
{"name":"run_command","arguments":{"command":"object.setOverprint","params":{"ids":[12],"stroke":true}}}
{"name":"run_command","arguments":{"command":"attributes.info","params":{"ids":[12]}}}
{"name":"run_command","arguments":{"command":"view.overprintPreview","params":{"on":true}}}
```

## Edit Colors and Recolor Artwork

`edit.colors.invert`, `edit.colors.toCMYK`, `edit.colors.toGrayscale`, `edit.colors.toRGB`, `edit.colors.saturate`,
`edit.colors.adjustBalance` and `recolor.apply` recolour everything inside the selection (or `ids`) in one undo step:
fills, strokes, text, gradient stops, gradient-mesh points, embedded images (a recoloured copy of the image; linked
images are left alone) and the tiles of pattern fills and strokes (a recoloured copy saved as a new pattern swatch,
e.g. "Dots 2"; the original pattern is untouched). `includeImages: false` / `includePatterns: false` leave images or
patterns out. The Blend commands also grade gradient meshes, which keep their shading.

```json
{"name":"run_command","arguments":{"command":"recolor.colors","params":{}}}
{"name":"run_command","arguments":{"command":"recolor.apply","params":{"map":{"#ff0000":"#0055ff"},"includeImages":false}}}
{"name":"run_command","arguments":{"command":"edit.colors.adjustBalance","params":{"mode":"cmyk","m":-20,"k":10}}}
```

## Group, layer and type appearance

Groups and layers carry fills, strokes and effects of their own, as in the reference app: their fills and strokes
paint every member's geometry, and their effects apply to the members as one piece (one combined drop shadow; a
Transform or Warp moves or bends the whole group). Their Contents row (type: Characters) is a slot in the stack:
fills and strokes above it paint over the members (characters), those below under them; new items go above it.
`appearance.moveItem {"from": "contents", "to": n}` puts the row above the bottom `n` items, and an item move takes
`contents` to say where the row ends up in the same undo step; `document.node` shows the slot as
`appearance.contents_index`. The `appearance.*`, `effect.*` and `graphicStyle.apply` commands edit the selected
objects themselves (a group's own stack; layers through `ids`) or, with `target: "contents"`, the objects inside the
groups and layers. `appearance.targetContents` selects a group's members (double-clicking the Contents row).
SVG and PDF export bake a group's own fills, strokes and geometry effects into paths; its raster effects stay a
filter on the whole group.

```json
{"name":"run_command","arguments":{"command":"appearance.addFill","params":{"ids":[7]}}}
{"name":"run_command","arguments":{"command":"appearance.moveItem","params":{"ids":[7],"from":"contents","to":1}}}
{"name":"run_command","arguments":{"command":"effect.apply","params":{"ids":[2],"effect":"stylize.dropShadow"}}}
{"name":"run_command","arguments":{"command":"appearance.addStroke","params":{"ids":[7],"target":"contents"}}}

## Swatch libraries

Swatch libraries are read-only sets of swatches computed in code (Web Safe 216, Grays and Neutrals, Earth Tones,
Skin Tone Ramps, Pastels, Brights, Metallic Gradients, Perceptual Scales, Harmony Sets). `swatch.library.list` lists
them (`id`, `name`, `category`, `count`) and `swatch.library.get {library}` returns one's swatches and colour groups
in the `swatch.list` shape (`library` is an id or a name). `swatch.library.add {library, names?}` copies swatches
into the document as one undo step: a colour group's name brings the whole group, a swatch's name the swatch alone,
no names the whole library; swatches the document already has (same name and paint) are reported under `existing`
and not added again. `apply: "fill"|"stroke"` also applies the first one, in the same undo step (what clicking a
swatch in the library panel does). `swatch.resetDefaults {replace?}` brings back the missing default swatches.

```json
{"name":"run_command","arguments":{"command":"swatch.library.get","params":{"library":"earth-tones"}}}
{"name":"run_command","arguments":{"command":"swatch.library.add","params":{"library":"earth-tones","names":["Clay"]}}}
```
